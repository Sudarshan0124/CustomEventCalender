# Event Calendar Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack event calendar application built with React and Express. The application provides a dynamic, interactive calendar interface where users can manage their schedule by adding, editing, deleting, and viewing events. It features a monthly calendar view with drag-and-drop functionality, recurring events support, and event conflict detection.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with a clear separation between frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: React application built with Vite, using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and React hooks for local state

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Client Directory**: Contains the React application with components, pages, hooks, and utilities
- **Component Structure**: Organized into UI components (reusable) and feature-specific components (calendar)
- **Routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Express Server**: RESTful API with proper error handling and request logging
- **Data Layer**: Abstracted storage interface supporting both in-memory and database implementations
- **Route Handlers**: Organized API endpoints for event CRUD operations
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for JSON parsing and request logging

### Database Schema
- **Events Table**: Stores event data with support for recurring events and categorization
- **Users Table**: Basic user management (currently unused but prepared for future authentication)
- **Schema Validation**: Drizzle Zod integration for type-safe database operations

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls through TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle requests and interact with the storage layer
3. **Data Persistence**: Storage interface abstracts database operations using Drizzle ORM
4. **Response Handling**: Optimistic updates and cache invalidation for real-time UI updates
5. **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly toast notifications

### Event Management Flow
- Events are created through modal forms with validation
- Drag-and-drop functionality allows rescheduling with conflict detection
- Recurring events are handled with configurable patterns
- Real-time updates ensure calendar state consistency

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18+ with TypeScript support
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS processing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Hookform Resolvers
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation and formatting

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution

### Build Tools
- **Bundler**: Vite with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Build Process**: Separate build commands for client and server
